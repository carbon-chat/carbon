Carbon is a ðŸ“– open-source, ðŸª™ free messaging server built apon the Carbon Specification.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide ðŸ”’ secure, and ðŸŽ¯ robust messaging for everyone.

## How it Works

Carbon Clients connect to an instance of an [Carbon Server](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon-meta). The client uses the [Carbon.js](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon.js) library to communicate with the server to send and receive messages, voice and video calls, and more.

## Getting Started

Open an Carbon Client from [our clients list](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon-meta).
