Carbon is an ðŸ“– open-source, ðŸª™ free messaging server built on the Carbon Specification.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide ðŸ”’ secure, ðŸŽ¯ robust messaging for everyone.

## How it Works

Carbon Clients connect to an instance of a Carbon Server. The client uses the [Carbon.js](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon.js) library to communicate with the server to send and receive messages, voice and video calls, and more.

## Getting Started

Open a Carbon Client from [our clients list](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon/wiki/Carbon-Supported-Clients).
